<h2>Chamorro Local Favorite Sauce</h2>
 <p>Finadene sauce is a Chamorro condiment that is spicy, tangy, and full of umami. It’s simple to make, and goes great on a while variety of thing! </p>    
 <p>You can use this sauce the day of, but I really recommed letting it sit in the fridge for a couple days to allow those flavors to melt together. You can keep it in the fridge for about a week and the longer it sits, the spicier it’ll get!</p>
